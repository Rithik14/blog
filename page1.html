<br>
<p>If you are looking for a refreshing and affordable drink in Mangalore, you might want to check out Bonda Factory, a shop that sells tender coconut water in bulk at very cheap rates. Bonda Factory is located in Adyar, about 10 km away from the city center, and is run by Naturals, an ice cream brand that uses tender coconut cream for its products.</p>

<br>
<p>Bonda Factory gets its name from the fact that it uses a machine to extract the water and cream from the tender coconuts, leaving behind the shells or bondas. The water is then stored in a refrigerated tank and dispensed to customers in glasses or bottles. The cream is used to make ice cream, which is also sold at the shop.</p>

<br>
<p>The main attraction of Bonda Factory is the price of the tender coconut water. A glass of 250 ml costs only Rs 8, while a liter costs Rs 30. This is much cheaper than buying a whole tender coconut from the roadside, which can cost anywhere between Rs 30 to Rs 55 depending on the size and location. Moreover, you don't have to worry about the quality or freshness of the water, as it is filtered and chilled before serving.</p>

<br>
<p>Another benefit of Bonda Factory is that you can also enjoy some delicious ice cream made from natural ingredients. Naturals is known for its variety of flavors, such as tender coconut, sitaphal, mango, jackfruit, chikoo, and more. The ice cream is creamy and rich, and goes well with the tender coconut water. A scoop of ice cream costs Rs 65, while a sundae with toppings costs Rs 80 to Rs 90.</p>
<br>
<p>Bonda Factory is open from 10:30 AM to 5 PM on weekdays only, and closed on Sundays and bank holidays. It also has a lunch break from 1 PM to 2 PM. The shop has a small seating area where you can sit and enjoy your drink and dessert. The place is clean and hygienic, and the staff are friendly and helpful.</p>
<br>
<p>Bonda Factory is a unique place to visit in Mangalore, where you can quench your thirst and satisfy your sweet tooth at the same time. It is also a great way to support a local business that uses natural and eco-friendly products. If you are ever in Mangalore, don't miss this opportunity to try some fresh tender coconut water and ice cream at Bonda Factory.</p>
